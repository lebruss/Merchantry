This is a text-based browser game I am making to entertain myself and learn / practice TypeScript, HTML & CSS, and responsible coding habits.
You are a merchant who buys and sells goods, traveling between Helsiki, Tallinn, and Stockholm.

To run the game, open merchantry.html . Two files, scripts.js and styles.css, must be in its same folder.
